Personal project to sharpen html/css skills. 

This will consist most of the data used to create my website. 
My personal project is to create a website that can be used as a platform to present any personal or professional accomplishments.

My goal through this project is to make a something that can be fluid with design.
This will also give me a step to pursue my passion in my cyber career.
HTML and CSS are my main goals in this repository, JS and/or PHP are not in mind at the moment, but will not be completely off the table.

I initially started a website project in June of 2020 but I did not have content or the creative fuel to kick off my motivation. 
I am now at the beginning of a long and bright future, my desire is to be a better me than I was yesterday. 

This README.md will be editted as needed
